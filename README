xrandrbg is a tool for setting background images in a
multihead environment.

Although there are programs that cope with this situation (e.g. feh or nitrogen)
they required to be run again when the screen configuration changed.

xrandrbg takes advantage of the xrandr extension of the X server (hence the name).

Dependencies:
  X11, Xrandr, cairo, confuse

The main setup is done via a config file with one ore more output sections, e.g.

output "VGA1" {
  file = "/home/user/images/vga1.png"
  color = "#000000"
  mode = "centered"
}

If xrandrbg.conf is your configuration file, call
 xrandr xrandrbg.conf

Currently no globbing is implemented, but will come in the future.

If you specify "default" for the output name, this section is taken for all
outputs that are not mentioned in this file.
